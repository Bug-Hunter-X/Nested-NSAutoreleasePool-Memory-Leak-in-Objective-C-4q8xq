In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises when dealing with memory management and `NSAutoreleasePool`.  Specifically, if you create a deeply nested autorelease pool within a long-running operation and fail to drain it properly, you might encounter unexpected crashes or memory leaks. This happens because objects added to the inner pool are not released until that specific pool is drained, potentially causing the system to run out of memory or leading to dangling pointers after the inner pool's scope ends.  This is particularly problematic in multi-threaded environments where these pools might interact in unpredictable ways.
